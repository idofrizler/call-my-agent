**Title: The Fox and the Wise Little Hen**

Once upon a time, in a lush green meadow that bordered a dense forest, there lived a clever little red fox named Felix. Felix was known throughout the forest for his quick wit and sneaky ways. He could outsmart almost anyone—or so he thought. But beyond the meadow, on a sunny little farm, lived someone just as clever: a small, bright-eyed hen named Hattie.

Hattie wasn’t like the other hens on the farm. While they clucked and pecked through the day, Hattie loved to sit under the big oak tree and listen to stories about the world beyond the farm. She dreamed of adventure but knew that the woods could be dangerous, especially with someone like Felix lurking nearby.

One sunny morning, Felix peeked out from the shadows of the forest, his sharp eyes fixed on the henhouse. He had heard from the squirrels that Hattie was the tastiest and cleverest hen around, and Felix loved a challenge. Licking his chops, he hatched a plan to catch her.

Felix waited until the farmer trudged off to town and the other hens lazily napped. Then, he strode confidently into the farmyard, wearing his most charming smile.

"Good morning, little Miss Hattie," Felix said with a bow, his tail swishing behind him. "I’ve heard tales of how smart you are. Could you help me with a problem I simply can’t solve?"

Hattie tilted her head, her feathers fluffing up in suspicion. "Oh? What sort of problem?"

"I’m hosting a grand forest feast," Felix explained, his voice silkier than butter. "But I don’t know what the best appetizer would be. I’ve asked the rabbits, the squirrels, and even the owls, but none seem to have the answer. Perhaps someone as clever as you could tell me?"

Hattie thought for a moment, her sharp eyes narrowing. She had heard plenty of stories about foxes and their tricks. "Well," she clucked, "if you want the best appetizer, you’ll need something truly special. Why don’t you meet me at the edge of the forest tomorrow morning? I’ll bring you the answer."

Felix’s ears perked up in delight. "It’s a deal, dear Hattie!" he said with a sly grin. "I’ll be waiting."

The next morning, as the sun peeked over the horizon, Felix paced eagerly at the forest’s edge, his stomach growling with anticipation. Soon, he spotted Hattie waddling toward him, carrying a big, covered basket.

"Ah, you’ve brought me the perfect appetizer!" Felix exclaimed, his eyes sparkling.

"Indeed, I have," Hattie said with a sly smile, setting the basket down.

Felix sniffed the basket eagerly and lifted the lid—but instead of food, out sprang a swarm of buzzing bees! Startled, Felix yelped and dashed back into the forest, swatting at the angry bees that chased him all the way home.

Hattie stood at the edge of the meadow, laughing so hard her feathers shook. "I told you I’d bring you something truly special!" she called after him.

From that day on, Felix kept his distance from the farm, and Hattie became famous among the other animals for outsmarting the cleverest fox in the forest. And while she still dreamed of adventures, she knew one thing for certain: if ever danger came knocking, her quick thinking would keep her safe.

**Title: The Fox and the Wise Little Hen**  

Once upon a time, in a lush green meadow surrounded by a towering, whispering forest, lived a red fox named Felix who was as clever as they come. Felix had a reputation for being the trickster of the woods—always playing pranks on the rabbits, stealing eggs when nobody was looking, and sneakily snatching snacks from the picnics of wandering hikers.  

But Felix wasn’t just clever; he was a dreamer. And his dream was to catch the tastiest hen anyone could imagine. He had his eyes set on someone special: Hattie, the little golden hen who lived in a cozy farmyard at the edge of the meadow.  

Now, Hattie was no ordinary farm hen. While the other hens clucked and laid eggs all day, Hattie spent her mornings perched beneath the farmer's old oak tree, reading books he left behind, and her afternoons listening to the wise words of the barn owl. She was brave, witty, and sharp as the quill feathers on her wing.  

Felix watched her carefully one warm spring morning, hunched low in the tall grass, his amber eyes twinkling mischievously. "Today’s the day," he whispered to himself. "Today, I’ll finally outsmart her."  

So Felix trotted confidently into the farmyard under the guise of an innocent traveler.  

"Good morning, my dear Miss Hattie!" Felix greeted her with a low bow. "I’ve come seeking advice from the wisest creature I know—you."  

Hattie stopped pecking at the ground, her sharp eyes locking onto Felix. She didn’t trust him one bit. But instead of chasing him away, she puffed up her feathers and replied, "Why, what an honor, Mr. Fox. What do you need my wisdom for?"  

“Oh, it’s a matter of great importance,” Felix began, lowering his voice as if sharing a secret. “I’m hosting a grand forest feast, but I’m struggling to decide who should be the guest of honor. I was hoping you—being so clever—could lend me your insight."  

Hattie’s comb twitched as she thought, but she quickly saw through Felix’s foxy grin. "The guest of honor, you say? Hmm. How about this—I’ll think about it tonight and tell you tomorrow morning. Meet me by the old willow tree, at the edge of the forest, just after sunrise."  

“Marvelous!” Felix exclaimed, his tail swishing with excitement. "I look forward to your advice, bright Miss Hattie!"  

Felix ran back to his den, already imagining the feast he’d have with Hattie as the main course.  

But Hattie had a plan of her own.  

The next morning, as the sun’s golden rays stretched across the meadow, Felix trotted up to the old willow tree. Hattie was already there, carrying a small, round basket covered in a colorful cloth.  

"Good morning, Mr. Fox," said Hattie with a confident tilt of her feathered head. "I came up with the perfect solution to your problem."  

Felix’s mouth watered as he inched closer to the basket. "Do tell, do tell! Is it… you?"  

Hattie chuckled. "Not quite. Inside this basket lies the answer. Close your eyes, count to three, and open it."  

Felix, too eager to resist, squeezed his eyes shut and counted, "One... two... three!"  

When Felix opened his eyes and lifted the cloth on the basket, expecting a plump hen or a delicious treat, what he got was…  

*SPLAT!*  

Out came an explosion of flour and feathers, poofing into a giant cloud that engulfed his face. Felix sneezed, stumbled backward, and tripped over the tree roots, his usually perfect coat now dusted white.  

From behind the tree, Hattie let out a loud cackle of laughter. She had stuffed the basket with flour, paper feathers, and a drop of pepper—just enough to ensure Felix got a good sneeze!  

"Tricked you, Felix!" Hattie called, still laughing. "Didn’t anyone ever tell you? The cleverest plans can backfire with just a pinch of wit!"  

Felix, huffing and puffing, ran off into the woods, his pride as bruised as his ego. From then on, every time Felix saw Hattie waddling near the farm, he’d think twice before hatching any harebrained schemes.  

As for Hattie, she returned to her farmyard, earning a hero’s welcome from the other hens who now knew her as the wisest—and bravest—hen around.  

And Felix? He stuck to berries and mushrooms after that, having learned his lesson: a clever fox is no match for a wise little hen.  

The end. 🦊🐔

**Title: The Fox and the Wise Little Hen**

Once upon a time, in a quiet little meadow bordered by the whispering woods, lived a red fox named Felix. Felix was known throughout the forest for his cleverness and sly tricks. He loved a good challenge and prided himself on outsmarting all the woodland creatures.  

But rumor had it that there was someone even more cunning than Felix. Her name was Hattie—a little golden hen who lived on a nearby farm. Hattie wasn’t just clever; she was wise. While the other hens scratched at the dirt and squabbled over seeds, Hattie would sit under the shade of an old oak tree, listening to the farmer read stories about faraway lands.  

Now, Felix had heard about Hattie from the sparrows. “She’s tiny, she’s quick, and she’s smarter than anyone you’ve ever met,” they chirped. Felix loved a good challenge, but this was no ordinary challenge. He didn’t just want to outsmart Hattie—he wanted to make her his dinner!  

One sunny morning, Felix slinked out of the forest and into the farmyard. The other hens clucked nervously and scattered into the henhouse as soon as they saw his bushy tail. But not Hattie. She stood in the middle of the yard, her feathers fluffed, her bright eyes fixed squarely on Felix.  

“Good day, Miss Hattie,” said Felix, smoothing his fur and flashing a charming grin. “I’ve come for a friendly chat.”  

Hattie eyed him carefully. “A chat, you say?”  

“Why, of course!” Felix said, sitting back on his haunches. “I’ve heard tales of your great wisdom, and I simply had to meet you. You see, I’ve been trying to solve a riddle, but it’s far too tricky for me. Perhaps you can help?”  

Hattie tilted her head, intrigued but suspicious. “A riddle, you say? Go on, then. What’s the riddle?”  

“Oh, it’s a good one,” Felix said with a sly smile. “What’s the best way for a fox to catch a hen?” His amber eyes sparkled, and his tail flicked lazily behind him.  

Without missing a beat, Hattie clucked softly. “Hmm. That’s a tough one,” she said thoughtfully. “Why don’t you give me a day to think it over? I’ll have your answer tomorrow morning.”  

Felix’s grin grew wider. “Excellent!” he said. “Meet me at sunrise by the big willow tree near the forest’s edge. I can hardly wait!”  

As Felix trotted back to the woods, his stomach growled with anticipation. "Tomorrow," he thought, "I’ll have the wisest, juiciest hen in the meadow!"  

But Hattie had a plan.  

***

The next morning, as the sun cast its golden glow over the meadow, Felix was waiting eagerly by the willow tree. Sure enough, he soon spotted Hattie waddling toward him. She had a bundle tied in a red-checkered cloth slung across her wing.  

“Good morning, Mr. Fox!” Hattie called cheerfully.  

“Ah, my clever little hen,” Felix said, licking his chops. “Do you have the answer to my riddle?”  

“I do,” Hattie said with a nod. She set the bundle down in front of him. “The answer is inside this bundle. Open it, and you’ll see!”  

Felix’s eyes gleamed with excitement. He pulled the cloth open with his sharp teeth, expecting to find a savory treat inside. But instead—  

*SPLASH!*  

Out came a gush of sticky, gooey honey, splattering all over Felix’s fur! Before he could even react, a loud buzzing noise filled the air. A swarm of angry bees burst out from the nearby bushes, drawn to the scent of the honey.  

Felix yelped and bolted, sprinting back into the woods with the bees hot on his tail.  

From a safe distance, Hattie laughed so hard she nearly toppled over. “The best way for a fox to catch a hen,” she called after him, “is to *not* try to outsmart one in the first place!”  

***

From that day on, Felix never dared to set paw near Hattie’s farm again. And Hattie? She became a legend among the animals, known far and wide as the hen who outfoxed the fox.  

The other hens clucked with admiration, and even the barn owl tipped his head in respect whenever she passed.  

Hattie still spent her days reading under the oak tree, dreaming of adventures and solving riddles. And Felix? Well, he stuck to berries and mushrooms. As clever as he was, he knew better than to cross the wise little hen ever again.  

The end. 🦊🐔
